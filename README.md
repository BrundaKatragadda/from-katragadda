## CODE FENCING

In Python, you can merge a series of lists into a list of lists using the append() method.This will result in a list of lists where each individual list from the series is a sub-list in the merged list.For example, [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6] would merge into [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]].

```
def merge(*args, missing_val = None):
  max_length = max([len(lst) for lst in args])
  out_list = []

  for i in range(max_length):
    out_list.append([args[k][i] if i < len(args[k]) else missing_val for k in range(len(args))])

  return out_list
```
