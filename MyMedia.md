Origins of the Name "Harry Potter":

J.K. Rowling came up with the name "Harry Potter" on a train journey from Manchester to London. The character and the wizarding world began to take shape in her mind during that trip.
The Real Platform 9¾:

The iconic Platform 9¾ at King's Cross Station in London is a real location. It's a departure point for the Hogwarts Express, and there's even a sign and a trolley disappearing into the wall for fans to pose with.
